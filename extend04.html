                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p>Color Converter Used: <a href="https://www.cssportal.com/css-color-converter/" target="_blank">CSS Portal</a></p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>There are many differences between hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. A major difference is their ability to change specific aspects of the color. As if you want to make a color like blue lighter the entire hexadecimal would have to change. While with HSL you would only have to change one or two parts of the entire thing. Also with RGB you can change the opacity of a color with little effort. Each may have their own benfits but you gain more utility with RGB and HSL than with hexadecimal.  </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: My perferred color code format is hexadecimal because it is a quick and easy to add the color into your code. While the others may have more utility I would still perfer the quick and easy hexadecimal to input colors in my code.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary: HWB also know as hue, whiteness, and blackness is a way to put color into your code. This is done by using a hue of a color when both the whiteness and blackness is set to 0. When you change the white and black values it changes how much of the hue is turned into a grey color. </p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary: CMYK is a combination of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. This is mainly used for printers as that is how they present color values. It can be used is css and used to create many colors by change the combination of the four color.</p>
